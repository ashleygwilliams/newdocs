# Installing npm packages locally

<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/JDSfqFFbNYQ" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

There are two ways to install npm packages: locally or globally. You choose which kind of
installation to use based on how you want to use the package.

If you want to depend on the package from your own module using something like Node.js'
`require`, then you want to install locally, which is `npm install`'s default behavior.
On the other hand, if you want to use it as a command line tool, something like the grunt CLI,
then you want to [install it globally](/getting-started/installing-npm-packages-globally).

To learn more about the `install` command's behavior, check out the [CLI doc page][1].

## Installing

A package can be downloaded with the command 

```
> npm install <package_name>
```

This will create the `node_modules` directory in your current directory(if one doesn't exist yet),
and will download the package to that directory.

#### Test:

To confirm that `npm install` worked correctly, check to see that a `node_modules`
directory exists and that it contains a directory for the package(s) you installed.
You can do this by run `ls node_modules` on Unix systems, e.g. "OSX", "Debian", or `dir node_modules`
on Windows.

#### Example:

Install a package called `lodash`. Confirm that it ran successfully by listing the 
contents of the `node_modules` directory and seeing a directory called `lodash`.

```
> npm install lodash
> ls node_modules               # use `dir` for Windows

#=> lodash
```

## Which version of the package is installed?

If there is no `package.json` file in the local directory, the latest version of the
package is installed.

If there is `package.json` file, the latest version satisfying the [semver rule][2]
declared in `package.json` for that package (if there is any) is installed.

## Using the installed package

Once the package is in `node_modules`, you can use it in your code. For example, if you
are creating a Node.js module, you can `require` it.

#### Example:

Create a file named index.js, with the following code:

```javascript
// index.js
var lodash = require('lodash');

var output = lodash.without([1, 2, 3], 1);
console.log(output);
```

Run the code using `node index.js`. It should output `[2, 3]`.

If you had not properly installed `lodash`, you would receive this error:

```
module.js:340
    throw err;
          ^
Error: Cannot find module 'lodash'
```

To fix this, run `npm install lodash` in the same directory as your `index.js`.
