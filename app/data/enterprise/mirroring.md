# Mirroring the public registry

Sometimes you want your private registry to maintain copies of packages from the public registry. This is called mirroring, and companies do it for a number of reasons:

- To limit development to an approved set of packages
- To ensure developers and build machines can keep working even when there is a connectivity problem
- To maintain an independent copy of all package versions, in case an author unpublishes a version

You can set up different policies to dictate how your npm On-Site server manages mirroring.

NOTE: If you want clients to use the mirrored packages from your npm On-Site server instead of accessing them from the public registry, the clients must be [configured](/enterprise/client-configuration#using-your-private-registry-for-all-packages) to do so.

## Whitelisting

The default policy for mirroring is the whitelist policy. A whitelist provides a list of packages which should be copied to npm On-Site and periodically updated from the public registry.

The default location for the whitelist is `/usr/local/lib/npme/data/whitelist`.

### Whitelisting from the server

You can configure what packages should be copied from the public registry to npm On-Site on the server. Add packages to your whitelist by running this command on the server:

```
npmo add-package <packagename>
```

This will trigger mirroring for that package and all of its dependencies.

### Whitelisting from the client

If you do not want to set up your whitelist manually in advance, you can also configure your server to copy packages to your npm On-Site server (and add them to the whitelist automatically) when they are requested by a client. For example, if a client requested `lodash` from your npm On-Site server and it did not exist, then npm On-Site would look for `lodash` in the public registry, copy it over, add it to the whitelist, and then serve it to the client.

To allow clients to add packages to the whitelist, visit npm On-Site's admin console and set `Read through cache` to `Yes`.

## Full mirroring

A full mirror will copy all packages from the public registry to your npm On-Site server. Enable this by setting `policy to apply during replication` to `mirror` in npm On-Site's admin console (_http://myreg.mycompany.com:8800_).
