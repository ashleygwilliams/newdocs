# What are Organizations?

npm Organizations allow you to manage and monitor access to
both new and pre-existing public and private packages through the
use of teams.

A great way to think about Organizations is that they are the umbrella
structure that allows you to create teams and then grant package
access to those teams.

These docs can be seen as being separated into 2 sections: people and 
packages.

## Managing People ([`npm team`][7])

- [Creating an Organization][1]
- [Definition of Organizational Roles][2]
- [Teams and Team Member Access][3]

## Managing Package Access ([`npm access`][8])

An Organization can collaborate on 2 types of packages:

- [New packages scoped to the Organization][4]
- [Pre-existing public and private packages][5] 

Additionally, all team members have the ability to [monitor access to
packages][6].
