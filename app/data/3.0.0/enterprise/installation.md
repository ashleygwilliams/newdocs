# Installing the npm On-Site server

npm On-Site runs locally, on a server you control, with no external dependencies. Many organizations want this for security, regulatory, or operational reasons.

## Server setup

Follow the instructions in the [quickstart video](/enterprise/intro), or do the following:

1. [Sign up for a trial license](http://www.npmjs.org/onsite#contact) for npm On-Site.
2. Make sure you have a machine that meets the [installation requirements](/enterprise/requirements).
3. On the server, run ```sudo npm install npmo -g --unsafe```.
4. visit _http://myreg.mycompany.com:8800_, to configure your instance.

The installation process will require your billing email and the license key you received during signup.
