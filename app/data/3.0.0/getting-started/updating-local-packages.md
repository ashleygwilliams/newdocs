# Updating local packages

<iframe src="//www.youtube.com/embed/HRudtPGcOt4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

Every so often, you should update the packages you depend on so you can get any changes that have been made to code upstream.

To do this, run `npm update` in the same directory as your `package.json` file.

Test: Run `npm outdated`. There should not be any results.
