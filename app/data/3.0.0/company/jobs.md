# Nice People Matter: npm is hiring

We currently are looking for interns to join us in summer 2015. Even if that's not what you're looking for, if you would like to work with us and have skills you think would be helpful, please send an email with evidence of your experience (like your resume, or links to LinkedIn/GitHub/wherever) to jobs@npmjs.com.

We’d like to hear from you.

## Internships

If you're currently in full-time education (class of 2016 or 2017) and looking for a summer internship with an open-source project that can also pay you, we're happy to say that we can offer you a place at npm in partnership with our investors, as part of the [True Entrepreneur Corps](http://www.trueventures.com/tec/) program.

We are looking primarily for enthusiasm and intellectual curiosity, but any experience with JavaScript and especially Node.js is obviously a big advantage.

You'll be working on the open-source npm project itself, so your work will be code-reviewed by the same people who run the project, your commits will immediately benefit tens of thousands of active users, and will also be publicly verifiable by future employers.

Last year's intern, [Faiq](https://twitter.com/faiqus), wrote about [what he learned](http://www.trueventurestec.com/2014/06/26/some-useful-info-for-tech-interns/) on TEC's blog and also had this to say:

> Imagine working at a place with some of the best and kindest engineers, getting paid to write open source code, and being immersed in one of the most diverse developer communities ever. It sounds too good to be true, doesn't it? When you get a chance to work at npm, you'll be doing exactly that. Day to day, you'll get to work on challenging problems that push your limits as an engineer. You'll run into problems that'll seem impossible at first, but by the end of your internship will seem like a piece of cake! This internship is one of the most unique opportunities you'll get, so definitely give it a shot and apply!

Faiq worked on our website and search. Even after leaving npm, Faiq continues to be involved and has even [committed to npm core](https://github.com/npm/npm/commits/master?author=faiq). You can expect a similar range of opportunities, depending on your interests.

If you're interested, please send a brief email introducing yourself as well as a PDF or Google doc of your resume to [jobs@npmjs.com](mailto:jobs@npmjs.com) and include the word "internship" in your subject line. The internship is based out of our offices in Oakland, California. You must be part of the graduating class of 2016 or 2017 and legally able to work in the United States; we are not currently able to sponsor visa applications.


## About npm, Inc.

npm is the package manager for JavaScript. The team is small, and growing quickly. If you join us, you will see the company grow through numerous changes, and take a bunch of different roles.

npm’s mission is to take Open Source development to entirely new places. When everyone else is adding force, we work to reduce friction.

npm is not a typical product, and we are not a typical early-stage “work hard/play hard” startup. We are responsible adults with diverse backgrounds and interests, who take our careers and our lives seriously. We believe that the best way to iterate towards success is by taking care of ourselves, our families, our users, and one another. We aim for a sustainable approach to work and life, because that is the best way to maximize long-term speed, while retaining clarity of vision. Compassion is our strategy.

[Our offices](https://www.google.com/maps/place/200+Frank+H+Ogawa+Plaza/@37.805544,-122.2720659,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m2!3m1!1s0x808f80b1a2db786f:0x4685356d4acb43ef) are in downtown Oakland, California. We offer very competitive salaries, meaningful equity, and generous health, dental and vision benefits. We love it when you represent us at conferences.
